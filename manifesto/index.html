          "The absolute rationalism that is still in vogue allows us to consider
          only facts relating directly to our experience. Logical ends, on the
          contrary, escape us. It is pointless to add that experience itself has
          found itself increasingly circumscribed. It paces back and forth in a
          cage from which it is more and more difficult to make it emerge. It
          too leans for support on what is most immediately expedient, and it is
          protected by the sentinels of common sense. Under the pretense of
          civilization and progress, we have managed to banish from the mind
          everything that may rightly or wrongly be termed superstition, or
          fancy; forbidden is any kind of search for truth which is not in
          conformance with accepted practices."

      How does one express their contempt following the war? To want fantasy and
      imagine the unreal——was the war not enough to guide one's thoughts to
      something else? This is an act against rationalism. Rationalism has ruined
      us in this War.

        We argue for an unhabited mode of expression derived from the mind's

        explore the uncharted depths of the imagination with radical new methods
