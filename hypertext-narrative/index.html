      i spent the summer playing in the suburbs. media consumption at a minimum.
      a rest period for my brain. here is a song that reminds me of that time:

      i like that it is all guitar. i like that even though it is all guitar,
      you can get pretty into it. 0:50 is my favorite part.

      it's
      <a href="page2.html">colder</a>
      now and i am using my brain more. to kick off my september, i debuted my
      time in the city with this album from a while ago. a beautiful
      <a href="page3.html">sidewalk stroll</a>
      album. i think it's well known for tracks 7 and 16, but i feel a renewed
      joy listening to track 1 and 18 this time around. track 1 makes me walk
      1.5x faster than my normal pace and track 18 makes me want to skip down
      the street.
