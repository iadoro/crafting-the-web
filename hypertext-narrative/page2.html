      september consisted of a lot of rain. the kind of rain that makes you want
      to lay on a couch for a long time.

      i happened to move across the street from two friends i made in middle
      school. what a coincidence. together, we play a lot of mario kart. this is
      their huge flat screen tv and just one of my many losses. at first glance,
      it seems like i placed above three other people, but that is not the case.
      i am the baby mario in 9th place. but there are three other players also
      in 9th place. as much as i despise having to play this game, i think about
      it all the time ìÜë‡ºò ‚ãÜÔΩ°Àöìçäìãºìçä÷¥÷∂ ìÇÉ‚äπ ‡≥É‡øî‚Çä‚Ä¢
