      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
      and enjoyable comedy
    </p>

      both shows are written in a way that keep you hooked. i find myself
      indulging at night when it is time to head to bed. community is the sitcom
      kind of comedy and atlanta is the slightly introspective type. both
      wonderful. five stars for each, though i am rarely someone that likes to
      be scarce with my stars
    </p>
    <p>i know i only said two shows but it is actually 3 (actually 4)</p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
      <span style="color: #ff4000">3. king of the hill</span>
      ..... so peculiar, but i dabble. centers around this dude and his group of
      dudes that all live on a hill. don't want to spoil it much more for you.

      <span style="color: #ff4000">4. white lotus</span>
      — this was a rewatch. about this wealthy resort and some wealthy guests.
      keeps you on the edge of your seat because of the sound track, though i
      can rarely ever explain the plot.
      <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;i recommend
      watching s2 over s1 if you can only commit to a single season
    </p>
