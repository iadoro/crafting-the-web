      have you ever played that game? <br>
      that game where you avoid the side walk cracks? <br>
      while you avoid the cracks you try to keep the number of steps in each
      block consistent? two steps in one block ... maybe three . <br>
      i usually play this game on first ave on the way to the subway.

    i've been challenging myself with other games <br>
    like the reading on the subway game <br>
    if i am being honest, it feels like reading in the park is level 2. reading on the
    subway is level 7. <br>
    i find it hard to focus with so much going on. <br>
    but sometimes it is nice to just hold the book open and try <br>
    i am currently in the middle of
      <a

        target="_blank"
      >
        the secret history by donna tartt
      </a><br>
    i am actually at a part where some pretty weird stuff is happening.<br> 
    i think it intrigues me in a way that makes me want to read more
